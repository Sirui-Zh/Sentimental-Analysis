## Files Included
- `Sentimental Analysis.ipynb`: Full training code for baseline logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT model.
- `bert_submission.csv`: Kaggle submission file generated from the BERT model.
- `logistic_regression_submission.csv`: Kaggle submission file generated from the logistic regression model.

## Model Summary
- **BERT Model**: 
  - Pretrained `bert-base-uncased`
  - Fine-tuned with cross-entropy loss
  - Max sequence length: 32
  - Batch size: 16
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Achieved the best competition score

- **Baseline Logistic Regression**: 
  - TF-IDF vectorizer + simple logistic regression classifier.
  - Provided a reasonable baseline performance.

## Notes
- The BERT model significantly outperformed the traditional logistic regression approach.
- Fine-tuning and sequence length tuning were crucial for achieving a top-10 finish.
